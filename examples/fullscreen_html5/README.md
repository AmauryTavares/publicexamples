# Fullscreen HTML5
This example shows how to use a custom index.html to always resize the canvas based on available window dimensions.

## Use it!
Copy `fullscreen_html5/index.html` to your own project. Open `game.project` and scroll down to the HTML5 section and select the `index.html` in the `.html shell` field. Done!
